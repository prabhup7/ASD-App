# AARYA: A Kinesthetic Companion For Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder


# Abstract  :
Problem Statement :
Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) is defined as a condition or disorder that begins in childhood and that causes problems in communication. They also face problems with hand eye coordination because of which the child may experience issues and challenges on a day to day basis. 

# Proposed Solution :
Our application is a personalised learning method where children interact with the characters in the game with hand and body gestures. This natural way of interaction in a computer-based gaming environment increases children's attention, communication and skills. We are planning to use a gesture based interface like Microsoft Kinect so that the child can find it easier to interact in the real world environment. The child can be given few scenarios based on day -to-day activities and the kinect will detect the movement in the child's body which is reflected in the game and used to solve the scenario. These games can also be used to improve mathematical and thinking skills.

# Outcomes : 
Since the application used gesture based interface, an autistic child feels more connected to the application and assumes the application on the screen to be a real life scenario. Upon trying to interact with similar scenarios, eventually the child will get used to interacting with other individuals and develop better communication skills.

# User Stories :
 1. As an autistic child, I can complete specific tasks assigned to me to go to the next level.
 2. As a parent, I can create an account and track the progress of my task completion by logging into the application.

# Future Scope :
Aarya is linked to a database where the time taken for each activity is stored and the progress of the child can be accessed by teachers or parents. This database if given remote access can be reviewed by experts in the field so the experts can come up with better solutions and many more activities can be converted into interactive games. The application can also have an extension wherein the child can follow different and alternative action paths to encourage creativity.
Various other situations that involve social interaction can be included in the form of modules with multiple levels. Aarya could be made customizable in order to meet the needs of individual autistic children; a child might be left handed whereas the game is coded for a right-handed individual.
